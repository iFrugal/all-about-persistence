## ðŸ›  Key Components

### 1. **Pipeline**

Central to `the-transporter`, it orchestrates the entire data process flow, encompassing:

- **Schedules**: Dictate when the pipeline will be triggered.
- **Flows**: Define the data read, process, and write sequence.
- **Pre and Post Instructions**: Integrate custom scripts or tasks that encapsulate the entire pipeline.

### 2. **Flow**

Representing a unique data processing sequence, it features:

- **Reader**: Handles data acquisition and initial processing.
- **Writers**: Dictate the destination and manner of data writing.

### 3. **Reader & Writer**

While the reader governs data acquisition, the writer ensures the processed data reaches its destination:

- **Modes (Reader)**: Choose how data is fetched.
- **Actions (Writer)**: Determine the type of data writing operation.
